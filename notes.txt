To create a Django project on cmd type 
django-admin startproject project_name

To startup the server type
python3 manage.py runserver


To create a new app in a Django project use either
python manage.py startapp app_name
django-admin startapp app_name

First thing you do after creating an app is to copy the app
config class name in apps.py and put in settings.py under
INSTALLED_APP, for a member app it will be
'members.apps.MembersConfig'

To create tables for the default apps that came with Django
python manage.py migrate

To create subsequent tables or whenever a model is modified, the 3 code below should be ran
1. whenever you make changes to the django application
python manage.py makemigrations App_name

The above command returns a filename starting with a number
eg 0001_initial.py, use 0001 to create the corresponding tables
to keep track.

2. To create the database tables use
python manage.py sqlmigrate App_name 0001

3. After the above, run this to finish the table creation
python manage.py migrate

To add data into the database taboe we use the interactive Django shell
python django shell

To interact with the tables we need to import the models into the shell,
an example to import a model Item present in models.py in the food app
from food.models import Item

To view the data in the Item table use
 Item.objects.all()

 To add data into the database table Item, with columns item_name,item_desc and item_price use objects eg
 a = Item(item_name="Pizza", item_desc="Cheesy Pizza", item_price=20)

 After adding an item, type the following to save the data into the database
 a.save()

 To get the unique id of the added object use either
 a.id 
 a.pk 

To create a super user and access the admin panel to that can manage the database 
python manage.py createsuperuser
